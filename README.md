Hello there! I am a self taught front-end developer located in Vancouver, BC. Currently I am looking for an opportunity to jump start my career as a web developer. I was first exposed to coding during my undergrad at UBC where I took a few computer science classes as electives and instantly loved it. After a few years working in merchandising analytic roles, I have decided to start a new career path to finally pursue my passion for coding.
